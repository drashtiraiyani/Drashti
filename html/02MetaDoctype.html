    <h1>Doctypes Importance</h1>
    <p>The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every
        HTML or XHTML document.
        <br>
        The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
        <br>
        This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
        <br>
        All HTML need to have a DOCTYPE declared. The DOCTYPE is not actually an element or HTML tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the previous versions of HTML, there were different kinds of Doctypes that were declared in each version of HTML, but in HTML5 there is only one type of Doctype available.
